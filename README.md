cronnex
======

## What is it
cronnex is yet another video game console emulator that aims to run NES, SNES, MD, PS1 games.

The project was planned and initiated in the two-week quarantine due to coronavirus. 
It's just a toy for dealing with boredom initially. However, I decided to make this project a serious one later on.

A decent netplay mechanism is planned. 
Will provide APIs for machine learning experiments and AI algorithm development. 

Currently, this emulator is under heavy development. 
Supporting NES games is a WIP.
Developing the GUI is a WIP.
