# What is it
cronnex is yet another video game console emulator aims to run NES, SNES, MD, PS1 games.

The project was planned and initiated during the two-week quarantine for COVID-19.
Initially, it's just an expierment for adding a better netplay mechanism to an existing emulator, and provides APIs for my Q-learning project.

Later on, I decided to make this project a serious one.

Currently this emulator is under heavy development. 
Supporting on NES games is a WIP.
Developing the GUI is a WIP.


## release plan
The first playable version will be released in mid-April 2020.
